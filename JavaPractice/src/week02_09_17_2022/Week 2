Week 2

Topics:

 ** Variables
		-Primitive Data Types
		-String
        -Declaring multiple variables
        -Concatenation		
        -Primitive Type Castings
        -Arithmetic Operators

  ==============================
  Primitive Data Types:
    1- numerical primitives:
					double > float > long > int > short > byte
     
    2- boolean
    3- char


primitives:
	int: for integers
	double: for decimals
	char: for single characters, ''
	boolean: true/false

String: sequence of characters (String of text), "" (non-primitive)

===============================
Variables:

variable naming rules:
		1. MUST be unique
		2. camelCase
		3. Can Not start with digits
		4. starts with lower case letters
		5. Can Not be Java Reserved words
		6. Can Not have special characters other than _ and $
		7. readable, understandable


declare variable:
		dataType  variableName = data;

===============================
Addition: +
		
	 number +  number ==> addition
	 	1   +    2   ===> 3


Concatenation: +

		String + Data
		Data   + String
		String + String
===============================
Primitive Type Castings:

Implicit Casting: Smaller primitives can be directly assigned to larger primitive type		
Implicit Casting: Larger ptimitives can NOT be directly assigned to smaller primitive types (need to be casted manually)

================================
Tasks:

1. Create a class named SumTwoNumber, write a Java program to print the sum of two numbers. 

2. Create a class named DivideTwoNumber, write a Java program to divide two numbers and print on the screen.

3. Create a class named BasicCalculator. write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.


4. Create a class named GallonsToLitters, Write a program that can convert gallon (int) to litter (double)
					Hints: 1 gallon = 3.79 litters
							1000
							10000	


5. Create a class named EmployeeInfo. declare the following variables:
				1. name (String)
				2. age (int)
				3. gender (char)
				4. company (String)
				5. jobTitle (String)
				6. yearsOfExpereince (double)
				7. salary (int)
				8. isFullTime (boolean)
				9. isMarried (boolean)
				10. employeeId (String)
				11. SSN (String)							



 6. Create class named "TemperatureConverter" and make a main method

						- Write a Java program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius degree
						- Input a degree in Fahrenheit: 212

							Formula : 		C = (5(F-32))/9

							Expected Output:
							212.0 degree Fahrenheit is equal to 100.0 in Celsius


7. Create class named CircleCalculator, write a Java program to print the area and perimeter of a circle. 


8. Create class named ConvertMiutesToYearAndDay, write a Java program to convert minutes into a number of years and days.
     
     Input the number of minutes: 3456789
     Expected Output :
     3456789 minutes is approximately 6 years and 210 days

(Bonus)
9.Create class named CurrentTime, write a Java program that prints the current time.
