1- What do you know about Scanner class?
2- What is the difference between next() and nextLine() method in Scanner class?

==============================================
Warm Up Task :

 Create a class which is "Calculator" and add functions which are add, substract, divide and multiply.
 (Use switch case) 

================================================

 Topics:

   - String : 

        •An object that represents sequences of characters
		•String is immutable, Once the object is created it can’t be Modified.
		•There are two ways to create String object:
         
         - By String literal (String pool)
         - By new keyword




     * Presented in "java.lang" package 
     
     * Any class in "java.lang" package can be imported implicitly

 String Methods:

   * charAt(index) : returns the character at the given index, returns char
 
   * length()      : returns the total number of characters. returns int

   * toLowerCase() : make letters lower case

   * toUpperCase() : make letters upper case

   * trim()        : removes whitespace from both ends of a string

   * indexOf()     : returns the position of the first found occurrence of specified characters in a string

   * lastIndexOf() : returns the position of the last found occurrence of specified characters in a string

   * replace()     : searches a string for a specified value, and returns a new string where the specified values are replaced

   * replaceFirst(): replaces the first occurrence of a substring that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement

   * substring()   : returns a new string which is the substring of a specified string

   * repeat()      : repeats the string for given number of times. returns string

   * isEmpty()     : checks whether a string is empty or not (check the length is 0)

   * isBlank()     : checks whether a string is blank or not (length is not important)

   * equals()      : compares two strings. Returns true if the strings are equal, and false if not (check the value)

   * equalsIgnoreCase() : compares two strings, ignoring case considerations

   * startsWith()  : check the string starts with sequance of char or not

   * endsWith()    : check the string ends with sequance of char or not

   * contains()    : check the string contains in sequance of char or not

===================================================
   
   - Loops 

     1. For loop
     2. While loop
     3. Do while

  1- For Loop :

   for ( init ; test ; increment/decrement ) {
                   body
    
   }
  

  Tasks: 

  **** String :

  Task 1: Given a string, print the string made of its first two chars, so the String "Hello" yields “HE".

  Task 2: Create a logic print a new string made of 3 copies of the last 2 chars of the original string.
     
      Hint: The string length will be at least 2. 

  Task 3: Given a string, return a version without the first and last char, so "Hello" yields "ell".
      Hint: The string length will be at least 2.

  Task 4: Given a string, if the string begins with "red" or "blue" print that color string, otherwise print the empty string.
     
     *                 input :"redxx" → "red"
     *                 input :"xxred" → ""
     *                 input :"blueTimes" → "blue"

  Task 5: Given a string, return a "rotated left 2" version where the first 2 chars are moved to the end.    
     Hint: The string length will be at least 2.

     *                 input :"Hello" -> "lloHe"
     *                 input :"java" → "vaja"
     *                 input :"Hi" → "Hi"

  
  **** Loop : 

   Create a class LoopIntro

  - print numbers 0 to 100 

  - print even numbers 0 to 98

  - print odd numbers 1 to 99


  Task 6: Given a string password. Encrypt with "x" a given password and print.
     
    Hint: do with for loop
     
     * password: cydeo
     * encrypt with char :x
     * output:cxyxdxexox
