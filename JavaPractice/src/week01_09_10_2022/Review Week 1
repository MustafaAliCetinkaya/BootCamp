  **Introduction To Java 
What is java?
 
 - One of the programming language which is commonly used

Components in Java 

  - JVM: Java Virtual Machine 
    * in order to read and run byte codes 

  - JRE: Java Runtime Environment
    * it has ready java classes and libraries (in order to run java codes we should have it)

  - JDK: Java Development Kit
    * it has development tools (javac,jconsole,...) (in order to develop software we hould have it)

  - Javac: Java Compiler
    * in order to convert high level java syntax to byte code which is understandable for JVM 

What is IDE?
 
 - Integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application which is used for developng software applications. (we will learn IntelliJ)

How to open preference window?

 public static void main(String[] args) {}

=====================================
 **println() vs print() statement

  -- println(): after printing appends a new line after last character

  -- print(): after printing not append a new line after last character

=====================================
 **Comments
  -- single line comments : in order to put single comment line, we need use // 
  -- multi line comments : in order to put multi line comment line, we need use /* */
=====================================
 **Escape Sequences
   
  Escape sequences: MUST be given with double quote like "\n"

\n: starts a new line
\t: paragraph space(tab)
\\: single back slash
\": double quote
=====================================
