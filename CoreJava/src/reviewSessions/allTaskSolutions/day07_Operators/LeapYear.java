/*
2. create a class named LeapYear, and write a program that can
identify if the given year is leap Year, print true if it's leap year,
otherwise print false
        Ex:
             if  year = 2020
            output:
                2020 is leap year: true

Hint: if the number of year can be evenly divisible by 4 (with
remainder of zero), it's leap year
