    /*
    Remove one letter from a word so that resulting string will be as small as possible (alphabetically).

    Write a function solution that, given a string S consisting of N characters,
    returns the alphabetically smallest string that can be obtained by removing exactly one letter from S.

    Examples:
        1. Given S = "acb", by removing one letter, you can obtain "ac", "ab" or "cb".
                Your function should return "ab" (after removing 'c') since it is alphabetically smaller than "ac" and "bc".
        2. Given S = "hot", your function should return "ho", which is alphabetically smaller than "ht" and "ot".
        3. Given S = "codility", your function should return "cdility", which can be obtained by removing the second letter.
        4. Given S = "aaaa", your function should return "aaa". Any occurrence of 'a' can be removed.
