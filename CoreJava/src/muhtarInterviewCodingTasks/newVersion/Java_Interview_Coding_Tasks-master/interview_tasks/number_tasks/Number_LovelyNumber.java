           We consider a number to be lovely if it contains fewer than
        three instances of any distinct digit (in decimal representation).
                Examples of lovely numbers: 0, 100, 1232 and 9922;
                Examples of numbers that are not lovely: 1000 (contains three copies of digit '0'), 33533 (contains
                 four copies of digit '3').

        Write a function solution that, given integers A and B, returns
        the number of lovely integers in the range (A..B] (both ends
        included).

        Examples:
        1. Given A = 0, B = 0, your function should return 1, because o is
        lovely.
        2. Given A = 1, B = 111, your function should return 110, because
        the only integer in the range [1..111] that is not lovely is 111.
        3. Given A = 100000, B = 100000, your function should return 0,
        because 100000 is not lovely.
        Assume that:
            • A and B are integers within the range [0..100,000);
            • ASB.
        In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your
        solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
