Switch Statement: switch, case, default, break
		
	syntax:
		switch(Data){

			case data1:
					Statements;
					break;	

			case data2:
					Statements;
					break;	

			default:
					Statements;
					break;	

		}



	Case value MUST match with switch' data type and UNIQUE

	Switch' Data can not be long, float, double and boolean data types

	break: used for exiting the switch.
			if we don't give the break statement, switch statement continue to execute the next block(s) until the break statement or } of the switch

	default block gets executed if none of the case blocks matched.
			there can only be one default block

	or logic we can use it in switch by declaring case blocks back to back
