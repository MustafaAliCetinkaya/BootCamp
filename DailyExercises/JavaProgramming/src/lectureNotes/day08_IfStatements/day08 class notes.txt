Java Day08:
Topics: Recap
		Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
		If Statements:
				single if

Package name: day08_IfStatement

Warmup task:
	1. Create a class called IdentifyNumber, and write a program that can identify if the given number is positive, or negative or zero. 

			Ex:
				number = 200

			output:
		        200 is positive number: true
		        200 is negative number: false
		        200 is zero: false


    2. Create a class called EvenlyDivisible,and write a program that can check if a number is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 5		
    		Ex:
				number = 65;

			output:
				65 is divisible by 2: false
				65 is divisible by 3: false
				65 is divisible by 5: true 



Variables: Container for Data, makes the data reusable
		
		Declare:
			DataType VariableName = Data;

		DataTypes:
			int: for integer numbers	
			double: for decimal numbers
			char: for single characters, '', every single character has a number
			boolean: true/false

			String: String of text, ""


Concatenation: Concating a value (any type) to String, +

Operators:
	-, +, *, /, %
	--, ++
	=, +=, -=
	>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=

	&&, ||, !


&&: both
	in logical and operator, both expressions need to be true in order to return true

||: either
	in logical or operator only one expression needs to be true in order to return true




if statements:
	Single if: can be used creating cindition for 1 possible output


Task
	1. write a program that can display the name of the month

			number = 1 ~ 12

	2. write a program that can display the name of the day

			number = 1 ~ 7

	3. Write a program that can print the number of days in a month

			Ex:
				number = 1 ~ 12;

			output:
				31 Days


			Hints:
				Months that has 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
				Months that has 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
				Month that has 28 days: 2
