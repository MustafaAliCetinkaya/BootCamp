Topics:

* Operators
		- Arithmetic Operators (%)        
	
		- Unary Operators (+, -, ++, --)  
	
		- Shorthand Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
	
		- Relational Operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)

        - Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)

* If Statements:
        
        - Single If
        - If & Else Statement
        - Multi-Branch If


=================================
Unary Operators:
+  :	Addition	    ->  Adds together two values	            x + y	
-  :	Subtraction	    ->  Subtracts one value from another	    x - y	
*  :	Multiplication  ->	Multiplies two values	                x * y	
/  :	Division	    -> 	Divides one value by another	        x / y	
%  :	Modulus	        ->	Returns the division remainder	        x % y	
++ :	Increment       ->	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
-- :	Decrement	    ->	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

        
      Post vs Pre:
        Pre : changes the value immediately
          ++ a
          -- a
       post: changes the value in the second step.
          a ++
          a --

=============================
Shorthand Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
int a=a+5;
or
int a+=5;


int b=b-5;
or
int b-=5;


=========================
Relational Operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)


Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b

========================

Tasks:

Task 1 : Create a class which is "IntroPostIncrementDecrement" define a variable,
          
          int a=5;
          print a;
          print the a++;
          print the a--;
Task 2:  Create a class which is "IntroPreIncrementDecrement" define a variable,
          
          int a=5;
          print a;
          print the ++a;
          print the --a;

Task 3: Create a class which is "IsNumberPositive" and create a variable if the variable is positive print true


          
Task 4: Create a class which is "NumberPositiveOrNegaive" and create a variable if the variable is positive print "positive" if not "negative"


Task 5: Create a class which is "CalculateCarTax" 
        if the price between $20000 and $39999 taxRate=0.2 
        if the price between $40000 and $59999 taxRate=0.3
        if the price between $60000 and $80000 taxRate=0.4

Task 6: Create a class which is "FindTheResult" create a variable
    int a=15;
         if a is divisable by 3 add 20
         if a is divisable by 5 add 25
         if a is divisable by 15 add 50
