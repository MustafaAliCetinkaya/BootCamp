2- How we can create an object in java?

Warm Up Task:

 - Given a non-empty string like "Code" print a string like below output.

 *                                 Code → "CCoCodCode"
 *                                 abc → "aababc"
 *                                 ab → "aab"

============================================================
Topics:

  - For Loop + String
  - While Loop 
  - Do While Loop
  - Branching Statements

=============================================
- While Loop

 syntax:

 while(condition){
   statement;
 }
========================

- Do While Loop

 syntax

do{
statement;
}while(condition);

======================

- Branching Statements

break statement: exits the loop & switch
continue statement: skips the current iteration


Tasks:
 
Task 1: Given a sentence which is string find word how many times repeats in it.

Hint: use substring with for loop

input:
*                                String str="Java is java in everywhere is Java";
*                                String word="Java";
output:3


Task 2: Given a sentence which is string and count the words in it.

input:

  String str="Java is java in everywhere is Java";

  output:7

Task 3: Given a sentence which is string and print the each word.


input:

String str="Java is java in everywhere is Java";

output: 
Java
is
java
in
.
.
.



Task 4: Given a sentence which is string find word how many times repeats in it.

Hint: use replaceFirst() with while loop

input:
*                                String str="Java is java in everywhere is Java";
*                                String word="Java";
output:3

Task 5: Given a non-empty string and an int n, return a new string where the char at index n has been removed. The value of n will be a valid index of a char in the original string (i.e. n will be in the range 0..str.length()-1 inclusive).

input: 
 String word="Adamm";
 int index=3;

 output:
 Adam

Task 6: Given a sentence which is ended with "." included lettters, numbers, special charecters and then find hidden sentence.
input:
        String sentence = "Y*78*8*o770987987u a869869=r????23425235e t54898)!'^h^^&%e b+%^^e%&+s%&t g+%&%+u/%y&/s.&6756/D4o n556576ot5675 c657467a7657r7657e a6575b6575o5675u567t i5467t&";
