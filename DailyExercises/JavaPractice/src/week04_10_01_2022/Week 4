Review Questions

1- What do you know about pre and post increment/decrement?
2- What is the difference between & and && ?

Topics:
 
  * Nested If
  * Ternaries
  * Switch Statement
  * Scanner


  =======================================
  Nested If

   - Pre-condition

   if(condition){

    if(condition){

   
    }

   }

  =======================================
   Ternaries

   Ternaries: shortcut of if statement
if:        (Condition)?
else:                 :
else if:   :(Condition)?



Scanner

Scanner Class: used for getting user inputs

in order to use it: 

Needs to create an object from Scnanner

Syntax: 
Scanner referenceName = new Scanner(System.in);

Scanner methods:

	* nextInt() :in order to get int value from user as input
	* nextDouble() :in order to get double value from user as input
	* nextBoolean() :in order to get boolean value from user as input
	* next() :in order to get String value (only one word) from user as input
	* nextLine() :in order to get String value (with spaces) from user as input



***** if we are using nextLine() method after the other methods of scanner, we MUST provide one addition nextLine()
========================================
Switch Statement

Switch Statement: switch, case, default, break

syntax:

switch(Data){
       case data1:

        Statements;
        break;

       case data2:

       Statements;
       break;

       default:

       Statements;
       break;
}


- Case value MUST match with switch' data type and UNIQUE
- Switch' Data can not be long, float, double and boolean data types
- break: used for exiting the switch.
  ** if we don't give the break statement, switch statement continue to execute the next block(s) until the break statement

- default block gets executed if none of the case blocks matched. there can only be ONE DEFAULT block

==================================

Tasks: 

  Task 1: 
  Write a function:
			that, given a positive integer N  However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 shouldbe replaced by the word

				    			Codility -- 2
				    			Test     -- 3
				    			Coders   -- 5

			- If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers:2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order.

				    			EXPECTED

				    	numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replac√©e by CodilityTest
				    	INPUT : 6    OUTPUT :  CodilityTest

				    	numbers divisible by allthree numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
				    	INPUT : 30    OUTPUT :  CodilityTestCoders


Task 2:
 Given a character, the task is to check whether the given character is in upper case, lower case, or non-alphabetic 		character

							Input: ch = 'A'
							Output: A is an UpperCase character

							Input: ch = 'a'
							Output: a is an LowerCase character

							Input: ch = '0'
							Output: 0 is not an aplhabetic character

Task 3: ( Scanner Class can be used )



					        Create a program that accepts age and weight(kg) as int.

					        If age greater than or equal 18 and weight greater than 50 kg give a message
					        	EXPECTED  :  "You are eligible to donate blood"

					        If age greater than or equal 18 and weight smaller or equal than 50 kg give a message
					        	EXPECTED  :  "You are not eligible to donate blood"

					        If age is smaller than 18 "Age must be greater than 18"
					        	EXPECTED  :  "Age must be greater than 18"

  
Task 4: 

Given two integer inputs from user a and b and compare two values return the bigger one (use ternary)

Task 5: 

Create  a program that accepts animal as String

							DOG 	- domestic animal
							CAT 	- domestic animal
							TIGER 	- wild  animal

							For other animal - unknown animal

							INPUT : DOG 		EXPECTED OUTPUT : DOG is domestic animal
