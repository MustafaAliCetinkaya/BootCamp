Java Day27
Topic: Wrapper Classes

package: day27_WrapperClasses

warmup tasks:
	1. Replace Task:
		1.1 Create a method named replace that passes three parameters: integer array, integer index, integer newElement. The method replaces the element of the array at given index with the new element, and returns the new array.
				Ex:	
					arr = {1,2,3,4,5};

					replace(arr, 2, 30) ===> {1, 2, 30, 4, 5}


		1.2 Create the same functions for double arrays, char arrays, and String arrays


	2. RecplaceAll Task:
		2.1 Create a method named replaceAll that passes three parameters: integer array, integer oldElement, integer newElement. The method replaces all the element of the array that matching with the given old element with the given new element, and returns the new array.
			Ex:
				arr = {10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 30, 30};

				replaceAll(arr, 30, 300) ==> {10, 10, 20, 300, 40, 300, 300, 300}


		2.2 Create the same functions for double arrays, char arrays, and String arrays



Data Structures:
	
	1. Array: supports primitives & non primitives
	2. Collection: ONLY support non-primitives
	3. Map: ONLY support non-primitives





Wrapper classes:
		
		1. parse methods: converts String to primitive

		2. valueOf methods: converts String to wrapper class




PasswordValidation:
    Write a program that can verify if a password is a strong password. Characteristics of strong passwords are:
                1. Password MUST be at least have 8 characters long, and should not contain space
                2. PassWord should at least contain one upper case letter
                3. PassWord should at least contain one lower case letter
                4. Password should at least contain one special characters
                5. Password should at least contain a digit
