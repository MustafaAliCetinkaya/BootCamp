Practice Tasks:
	1. write a program that can swipe two variables' value by using a temporary variable

		    Ex:
		        if a= 10, b=15

		    output:
		        a = 15
		        b = 10

    2. create a class named LeapYear, and write a program that can identify if the given year is leap Year, print true if it's leap year, otherwise print false

	        Ex:
	             if  year = 2020 

	            output:
	                2020 is leap year: true

        Hint: if the number of year can be evenly divisible by 4 (with remainder of zero), it's leap year

	3. Create a class called SalaryCalculator.java
			3.1 declare the following variables:
					hourlyRate, weeklyHours, stateTaxRate, federalTaxRate

			3.2 use the given info in above variables to calculate the followings:
					1. salaryBeforeTax
					2. stateTax
					3. federalTax
					4. totalTax
					5. salaryAfterTax

					Hint: salaryBeforeTax = hourlyRate * weeklyHour * 52

			3.3 use print statement to print each of the above
				Ex:
					   hourlyRate = $50 
					   weeklyHours = 45
					   stateTaxRate = 6 (given as percentage, you need to convert to decimal)
					   federalTaxRate = 26 (given as percentage, you need to convert to decimal)

				    output:
				    	Gross pay is: $117000
				    	Federal tax is: $30420 
			    		State tax is: $7020
			    		Total tax is: $37440
			    		Net income is: 79560
