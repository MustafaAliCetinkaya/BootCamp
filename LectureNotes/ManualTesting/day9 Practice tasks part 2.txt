      			20% for salary less than 80K

                in addition, if the person is married, he/she will pay 5% less tax


3. Create a class called FINRA, Write a function which prints out the number. but for number which is a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the number and for number which is a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead of the number. and for number which is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FINRA" instead of the number.
            ex:
                number = 3
            output:
                      FIN

                number = 10
            output:
                RA

                number = 15
            output:
                FINRA

                Above 50 -  Be careful now you at at 50%

                USE ONE PRINT STATEMENT ONLY
