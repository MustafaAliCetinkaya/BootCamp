package name: day25_CusomMethod_Overloading

Warmup tasks:
	Task1:
	    1. create a method that can find the sum of two numbers
	                    method name: sumOf2Numbers

	    2. create a method that can find the sum of three numbers
	                    method name: sumOf3Numbers

	    3. create a method that can find the sum of four numbers
	                    method name: sumOf4Numbers

	Task2:
		1. create a return method called addInteger that can add an Inteeger  after the  last index of an integer array

Method Overloading: multiple different methods sharing the same method name
			same method name, different parameters

			return type, access modifiers and specifiers can be same or can be different

			Advantage:
				1. easy to memorize
				2. easy to read
				3. reusable
				4. flexible



Utility Classes:
	StringUtility
	ArrayUtility
	NumberUtility
