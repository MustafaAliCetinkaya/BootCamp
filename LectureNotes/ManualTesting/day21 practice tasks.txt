Tasks:
	1. Write a program that sort the array of integer in descending order

	2. Write a program that can count the even and odd number from an array of integers 

			Note: MUST use for each loop

	3. Write a program that can print out the common elements from two integer array
          Ex:
              arr1: {1,2,3,4,5}
              arr2: {4,5,6,7,8}

          output:
              4 5


          MUST use for each loops


    4. write a program that can count how many palindromes in an array of string
        Ex:
            {"anna", "level", "Java"};

            output:
                2


    5. Write a program that can merge 3 arrays of integers

    		Ex:
    			arr1 = {30, 10, 20};
    			arr2 = {15, 40, 25, 35};
    			arr3 = {8, 9, 17, 5, 4, 1}

			Output:
				{30,10,20,15,40,25,35,8,9,17,5,4,1}


	6. Write a program that can return the number of appearances of “java” and “python” anywhere in the sentence. 
				(similar to the task 97 in repl.it, but this time you MUST use arrays and for each loop)
