Package name: day20_Arrays

Array:
	1. Single Diemnsional
	2. Arrays Utility
	3. For Each Loop
	4. Multi-dimensional array


Data Structure: to use the data efficiently, store data in organized manner
		
		1. Array (size is fixed, supports primitives & non-primitives)
		2. Collection (size is not fixed, ONLY supports non-primitives)
		3. Map (size is not fixed, ONLY supports non-primitives)


regular variables:
	String name = "David"; //, "Josh"
	int number = 100;


Array: Special variable that can contain multiple elements
	   Size is fixed
	   supports primitives & non-primitives

	   Declaring array:

	   		DataType[] variablename;


   		Initializing array:

   			If we do not know the exact data:
   				1. DataType[] variablename= new DataType[length]
   					int[] nums = new int[5];


			If we know the exact data:
				2. DataType[] variablename = {data1, data2, dat3 ...}



Arrays Utility: Utility class of the array, provides the methods that can be used for the arrays
			class name: Arrays
			package: java.util


		toString(array): converts array to string



default values:
	non-primiitives: null
	primitives:
		byte, short, int, long ===> 0
		float, double ===> 0.0
		boolean ==> false


Tasks:
	1. create an array that has the numbers 1 to 100
	2. create an array that has the numbers 100 to 1
	3. Write a program that asks user to enter a number 10 times:
			1. store all user entered numbers in an array
			2. find the max number
			3. find the min number


	4. AverageNumber:
			1. Ask the user how many numbers they want to enter
			2. get all the inputs from the user and store them into an array
			3. Iterate the array & return the average number


	5. Items
			1. Create an array named items with the length of 5
			2. Create an array named prices with the length of 5
			3. Ask user to enter item name and price 5 times and store them into the items and prices arrays
			4. calculate the total price of the arrays
			5. display each item name and price in separate lines

						ItemName -- Price
