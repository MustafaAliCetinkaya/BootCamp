warmup task:
	1.Carpet Task:
		1.1 create a custom class for the Carpet class that should contain the following:
                Attributes:
                        width, length, unitPrice, isPersian (boolean)

				Add a constructor to set all the instances

                Actions:
                    calcCost(): should be able to calculate the total cost of the carpet and return it as double
                    toString(): should be able to display all the info of the carpet including the total cost of the carpet as calculated by calcCost()

            total price of carpet = (width*length)*unitprice

            if the carpet is persian  carpet, add 200$ to the totalPrice




ArrayList Short quiz:  due by 11:35 am


this: refers to the instances
	
	this. : to call instance variables & instance methods
	this() : used for calling the constructors


Constructor Call:
		1. Constructor can not be called by its name ( this() need to be used )
		2. Only a constructor can call another constructor
		3. Constructor call MUST be at the first step
		4. One constructor can not call more than one constructor
		5. Constructor can not call or conatin itself



class name: Car
		 instance variables:
		 		make, model, year, price, color

 		1st constructor: initializes the make ONLY

 		2nd constructor: initializes make & model
 				(MUST use constructor call to set the make)

		3rd constructor: initializes make, model, year
				(MUST use constructor call to set the make, model)

		4th constructor: initializes make, model, year, price
				(MUST use constructor call to set the make, model, year)

		5th Constructor: intializes all the instances
				(MUST use constructor call to set the make, mode, year, price, color)

		instance methods: toString
