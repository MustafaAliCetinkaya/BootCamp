Tasks
	1. Write a program that can divide two positive numbers without using / (division) and * (multiplication) operators.


	2. Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user until user enters a negative number.

            hint: you need an infinite loop


    3. write a program to ask user to enter two number and math operator, and return the result.
			
		if the operator is invalid operator, ask user to re-enter the operator until user provides a valid operator (+, -, *, /)


	4. Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ N that can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15.
	            if the number can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15,
	                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy15' section

	            if the number can be divisible by 3 but cannot be divisible by 15,
	                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy3' section

	            if the number can be divisible by 5 but cannot be divisible by 15,
	                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy5' section

	            EX:
	                input: 100

	                Output:
	                     Divisible By 15 15 30 45 60 75 90
	                     Divisible By 5 5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 85 95 100
	                     Divisible By 3 3 6 9 12 18 21 24 27 33 36 39 42 48 51 54 57 63 66 69 72 78 81 84 87 93 96 99



    5. Create a class called RommReservation, write a program for the room reservation, your program asks the user wants to reserve a room.
    	if user entered yes, then ask which type of room the user wants to reserve. if user entered no, print "have a nice day"
    			(if user entered any invalid answer (other than yes/no) ask user to reenter until user provides a valid entry)

	            King Bed ==> 120$
	            Queen Bed ==> 100$
	            single Bed ==> 80$

            the program should be able to display the room he/she reserved and total price of the room.

            (if the user selected an invalid room, ask the user to reselect the room until user provides a valid entry)


    6. Create a class called InsuranceQuote, write a program that can calculate the insurance cost of a person based on the following info:
    		1. Ask the user to enter your name
    		2. Ask the user to enter your gender
    			(if user enters invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry)
			3. Ask the user if he/she is married(Yes/No)
					(if user enters invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry)
			4. Ask user to enter your age
					(age can not be negative or greater than 120)
					(if user enters invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry)
			5. Ask user to enter how many miles he/she drives in a day
					(mileage can not be negative or less than 5)
					(if user enters invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry)
			6. Ask the user if he/she wants full coverage or liability insurance?

			7. Ask if he/she had any accidents or claims in past 5 years (Yes/No)
					(if user enters invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry)

			8. Ask the user if his/her car has an anti-theft device (Yes/No)
					(if user enters invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry)

		Calculate the price of the insurance and display all the info of the user

			Insurance Quote calculation:
				starting prices for liability:
					age < 25 ===> 90
					age >= 25 ==> 50

					miles <= 10 ====> $10
				    miles > 10 and miles <= 50 ==> $30
				    miles > 50 ===>  $50

				starting prices for full coverage:
					age < 25 ===> 160
					age >= 25 ==> 120

					miles <= 10 ====> $20
				    miles > 10 and miles <= 50 ==> $40
				    miles > 50 ===>  $70


			    If the car has anti-theft device ==> 5% discount
			    If he/she had any accidents or claims in past 5 years ===> 15% extra charge
			    If he/she never had any accidents or claims in past 5 years ==> 10% discount
			    If he/she is married ==> 5% discount
