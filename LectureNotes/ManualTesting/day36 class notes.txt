Java Day36
Topic: Inheritance Intro

package name: day36_Inheritance

warmup tasks:
	1. Create a class named Student:
			private variables:
				name, age, gender, grade, schoolName

			Encapsulate all the fileds (at least encapsulate two fields manually)
					requirments:
						1. age should not be set less than 5 or greater than 90
						2. gender should not be set to any chanarcter other than: 'M' and 'F'
						3. grade should not be set to any chanacters other than: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'F'

			Add a constructor that can set all teh fields when the object is created
						(requirments of fileds in the above must be applied)


			Methods:
				study()
				toString()


Encapsulation: hiding the fileds by giving private access modifiers
				
			  use getter/setter to read/write the private data


			  Getter (Read Only): public instance method 
			  					  Return type is not void
			  					  Return type must match with private instance variable' data type
			  					  Does not pass any parameter
			  					  Returns the private instance variables value

			  Setter (Write Only): public instance method 
			  					   Return type is void
			  					   Passes a parameter
			  					   Parameter' data type must match with private instance variable' data type
			  					   reassigns the private instance variable to given argument

			  					  



use the data:
	1. read
	2. write



Inheritance Topic:
		Is A relation
		extends keyword
		super keyword & constructor
		Types of Inheritance
		Is A relation vs Has A relation
		Method Overriding



Today:
	Is A relation
	extends keyword

Tomorrow:
		super keyword & constructor
		Types of Inheritance


Next Thursday:
	Is A relation vs Has A relation
	Method Overriding


Next Friday:
	implement both Inheritance and Encapsulation





Task:
	
	Animal:
		name, breed, gender, size, age, color
		setInfo(), eat(), drink(), move(), sleep(), toString()

	
	Dog extends Animal:
			bark()

	Cat extends Animal:
			scratch()

	Tiger extends Animal:
			roar()

	Fish extends Animal:
			swim()

	...



import vs extends:
		import: borrowing
		extends: owning


	inherit ->pass it through
	import -> let using

	



lunch task:
	
	Employee:
		name, gender, age, jobTitle, id, salary, companyName
		setInfo(), work(), toString()


	Tester
