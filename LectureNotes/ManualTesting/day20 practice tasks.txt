1. create an array named classmates, and store 10 of your classmates' full names
            print the initials of each classmates in separate lines

2. create string array, and store the names of your  class mates (10)
            reverse each students names and print them in separate lines
            	ex:
            		arr = {java, python, c#}

        		output:
        			avaJ
        			nohtyp
        			#c
	
3. Given the following arrays:
        String[] items  = {"Shoes", "Jacket",  "Gloves", "AirPods", "iPad", "iPhone 12 case" };
        double[] prices = {99.99,      150.0,  9.99,     250.0 ,    439.50,  39.99};
        int[] itemIDs =   {12345 ,     12346,  12347,    12348,     12349,    12350};


        1. find out the first index number of "Gloves"

        2. find out if "iPad" is contained in the item list

        3. Print the report of each shopping item
            name - price - #ID



4. given the following arrays:
		     	String [] names = {"Anna", "Nancy", "Sarah"};
		        int [] scores = {90, 75, 80};
		        char [] grades = new char[names.length];

         1. write a program that can store the grades of the students in the array named grades
         2. print the grade report of each students in separate lines
         		Ex:
         			Anna's score is 90, and grade is A


	5.  Write a program that can reverse an array of integers and returns it as new array
        ex:
            array = {1,2,3,4,5};

        output:
            reversedArray = {5,4,3,2,1};


6. write a program that can move all the zeros to the end of the array
        Ex:
            array = {10, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0};

            output:
                 {10, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0}

  	
7. Write a program that can print out the common elements from two integer array
          Ex:
              arr1: {1,2,3,4,5}
              arr2: {4,5,6,7,8}

          output:
              4 5
