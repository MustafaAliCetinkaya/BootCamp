Tasks:

	1. Write a program that can return the sum of even numbers between 1 to 100

	2. Write a program that can return the sum of odd numbers between 1 to 100

	3. write a program that can calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 to any given number
            ex:
                input: 100
                output: 5050

                input: 50
                output: 1275 


	4. Write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number

            Ex:
                input: 5
                output: 120  

                	( because: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120 )


    5. write a program that can retive the digits, letters and special characters from a string
            Ex:
                input:
                    mn@#123Ab!

                output:
                    letters: mnAb
                    digits: 123
                    special chars: @#!


    6. Write a program that can return the sum of digits from a  string
             Ex:
                 input: A1B2C3

                 output:    6

             Hint: You need to get each of the character by using a loop
	             	To convert char to number:
						             	   '0' - 48   ==> 0
						             	   '1' - 48   ==> 1
						             	   		...


	7. Write a program that can reverse any given string

			Ex:
				input: 
					Wooden Spoon

				output:
					noopS nedooW


	8. Write a program that can check if the given String is palindrome

			Ex:
				input:
					Level

				output:
					true


				input:
					Anna

				output:
					true
