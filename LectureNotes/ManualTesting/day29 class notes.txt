Java Day29
Topic: ArrayList Continue
	   Collections Utility Class


package name: day29_ArrayList


warmup tasks:
	1. Write a program that can return the first unique elements from an arraylist

			Do not use indexOf & lastIndexOf methods


	2. Write a program that can find the maximum, minimum and average number from an arrayList of integers




Bulk Operations: argumnet MUST be a collection type

	addAll(CollectionType): adds collection of values to the arrayList
	removeAll(CollectionType): removes all the matching elements from the arraylist
	retainAll(CollectionType): removes all the non-matching elements from the arraylist
	containsAll(CollectionType): checks if all the elements are contained in the arraylist


Arrays:
	asList(array of values) ===> returns the array as collectionType




Remove functions:
	remove(): when we remove one element. DO NOT use it in the loop
	removeAll(): when we remove multiple elements ( if the elements that we want to remove are known)
	retainAll(): when we want to retain multiple elements (if the elements that we want to retain are known)
	removeIf(): when we remove under a condition (if the elements we want to remove are unknown)



Collections: utility class of collection
	
	sort()
	reverse()
	swap()
	max()
	min()
	replaceAll()
	frequency()



Array vs ArrayList: both has index numbers
		
		ArrayList: size is not fixed
				   only supports non-primitives
				   Can not be multi-dimensional

		Array: size is fixed
			   supports both primitives & non-primitives
			   Can be multi-Dimensional




1. write a program that can return the nth largest number from an arraylist
			
			arraylist = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 7 ,8, 8}
			n = 5

			output:
				4
