Java Day06:
Topics: Primitive Type Castings
		Arithmetic Operators

Package name: day06_PrimitiveTypeCastings

Warmup tasks
	1. Create a class named BirthDay and create the following variable
			 name, birthDay(int), birthMonth(String), birthYear(int)

			 use concatenation to display the birthday of the person

			 	if  name = "John"
			 		birthDay = 25
			 	    birthMonth = "April"
			 	    birthYear = 1995;

			 	output:
			 		John was born on April/25/1995.


Primitives:
	
	double > float > long > int > short > byte

	smaller primitives can be directly assigned to larger primitive type
	larger ptimitives can NOT be directly assigned to smaller primitive types (need to be casted manually)
