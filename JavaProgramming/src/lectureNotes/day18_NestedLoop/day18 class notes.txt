Topic: Nested Loop

package name: day18_Nested Loop

warmup tasks:
        1.  Write a program that can divide two positive numbers without using / (division) and * (multiplication) and % operators

                        20 / 6 ==> 3 with the reaminder of 2
                        

                        a = 20
                        b = 6;


                        a -= b;  // a = 14
                        a -= b;  // a = 8
                        a -= b;  // a = 2


                        x = 100;
                        y = 8;

                        while(a >= b){
                                a -= b;
                                count++;
                        }

        2. You are writing a code for the log-in function of the Cydeo Application, assume that your credentials are:
                            username: Cydeo
                            password: WoodenSpoon

                Ask the user to enter their credentials. 
                        If credentials are matched, your program should print "Logged in." 
                        If the credentials are not matched, the program should allow the user to have three attempts to enter correct credentials and if all three attempts are failed, then print "Your account is locked."



Nested loop:  loop inside another loop (inner & outer loops)
        
        one iteration of the outer loop, executes all the iteration of the inner loop




1. Print the following shape by using a nested Loop:
         * * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * * *


2. Write a program that asks user to enter a numnber , and check if the number is odd or even.
        if it's odd, print "Odd Number"
        if it's even, print "Even number"

        Ask the user "Would you like to enter another number"
                if user enters yes, repeat the previous steps
                if user enters no, print nothing

                If user enteres invalid answer, repeat the previous steps



lunch:
Use a nested loop to print the following shape
        *

        * * * *
        * * * * *
        * * * * * *
        * * * * * * *
        * * * * * * * *
        * * * * * * * * *
