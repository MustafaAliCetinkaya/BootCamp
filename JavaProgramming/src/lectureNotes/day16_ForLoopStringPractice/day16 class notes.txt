			Hint: You can add each characters of the string into another String 
				  Condition: the character is not contained in the other String yet before you are adding

	3. Write a program that can return the unique characters from a String

			Ex:
				input:
					AABCCD

				output:
					BD

			Hint: You will need indexOf() and lastIndexOf()
				  if the first and last index numbers of the character are same, then it's unique



				  indexOf('A') ==> 0
				  lastIndexOf('A') ==> 1


				  indexOf('B') ==>2
				  lastIndexOf('B') ==> 2
