Java Day19
Topics: Loops Practices
		Loops without curly braces
		System.exits(0)


Package Name: day19_LoopPractices


Tasks:
	1. Write a program that can find the frequency of the characters from a string

			 Ex:
                        str = "aabcccd";

                        output:
                                a2b1c3d1
       

	2. Write a program that can find the unique characters from a string without using indexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods

    			Ex:
                        str = "aabccdeef";

                        output:
                                bdf

Loop: repeated action
	
	for loop: iteration is fixed

			for( initi; condition; iteration){
				statements
			}

			initialization: starting point
					int i = 5; 

			condition: ending point
					i < 10 ,  i >= 0

			iterator: Co-related to the condition. runs long enough to make the condition false
					i++, i++


	while loop: iteration is not fixed. repeated If

			while(condition){
				statements
			}


	do-while loop: iteration is not fixed

			do{
				statements
			}while(condition);

			at least gets executed once


Nested Loop: loop inside a loop (inner & outer)
		
		outer loop repeats the inner



String short quiz due by 11:40 am


Branching statements:
		break: exits the loop & switch
		continue: skips the current iteration of the loop
		System.exit(0): terminates the current program, terminates the JVM


Tasks:
	1. Write a program that can return the first duplicated character from a string
	2. Write a program that cna return the index number of the first duplicated character from a string
	3. Write a program that can display all the characters that appeared twice in the string.
	4. Write a program that can return the index number of the first unique character.
